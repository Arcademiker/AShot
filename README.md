# Theta star + visualizer
another AStar like algorithm, that calculates shortest pythagorean distance on maps with "walls".

Theta Star visualization: The shortest paths leading over the same pixel are colored
uniformly. A complete minimum span tree is generated for all pixels. The search for the
shortest routes is uninformed. To speed up the algorithm a few assumptions were made
about adjacent pixels, whereby I initially made a mistake that generated these interesting
striped patterns under "Australia" and "Madagascar".
